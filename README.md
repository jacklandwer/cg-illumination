3D illumination &amp; shading starter code using the Babylon and WebGL APIs

# Signature work

Project 3: cg-illumination
- https://jacklandwer.github.io/cg-illumination/
- Site that does Gouraud shading and Phong shading on different scenes that contain shapes.
- There are multiple scenes that include height-maps and each have different shape models on them.
- There are multiple lighting sources with different color and light attributes, which can be translated from keyboard input.
- To run this project, you just have to go to the link since its live on GitHub.
- You can use the mouse to drag the view around the scene. 
- The WASDRF keys will translate the different light sources about the scene. 
- You can use the dropdown menu to switch between scenes, between using Gouraud and Phong shading/illumination, and switch between the different light sources. 
- The height displacement slider alters the height of the height-map in the scene.
